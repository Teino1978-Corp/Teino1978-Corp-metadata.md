## Author/Contributor Metadata

Information about an author can include: firstname, lastname, fullname, lastname-comma-firstname, role, primary-or-notprimary, photo, photo credit, photo orientation, residence, biographical information. Some books have multiple contributors.

| Site | Notes |
| ---- | ----- |
| iBooks | Author information is entered in a native Mac app, iTunes Producer, on the "details" tab of a new book file, and stored locally as an .itmsp file. Dropdown for Role (with an insane long list of predetermined roles), dropdown specifying whether the role is Primary or Not Primary, two text areas for author name: "Firstname Lastname", and "Lastname, Firstname" |
| Nook | Separate fields for First Name, Last Name, and Role, entered on Title & Description page of NOOK Book Details section. Max of 5 "contributor" objects. Plain-textarea limited to 2,500 characters for "About the Author(s)". |
| Kobo | Single text field for "Firstname Lastname". First entry is automatically designated as Primary author. Max 3 authors. |
| Google | Contributors are each entered on the "Book Catalog > General Details" panel as a single textfield for "Firstname Lastname" accompanied by a dropdown for role. There appears to be no limit on contributors. There is a single rich-textarea for a combined Biographical Note. |
| Kindle | Book contributors are entered in a modal on the title setup screen with separate fields for "First (or Given) name", "Last name (or Surname)", and a dropdown for "Title". They must be entered in the order they should be listed in the store. |
| Helix | In the Title AI Edit screen, there is a field group called Contributors, incluiding: Contributor Display Name(s), Name (single field Last, First), "City, State & Country", and Type/Role. In AI Sell Sheet Copy is a plaintext field which accepts limited HTML for Contributor Information, Contributor Residences. Publisher Catalog Copy also includes a text area w/ limited HTML support for "Contributor/Author Bio". Consumer Copy page also has a Contibutor Info/Author Bio textarea with a max of 2000 words. |
| Creatavist | Author information is entered and stored in two places per story: 1) in a native Creatavist field, which is a typeahead textbox that creates an array of story authors on hitting [enter], 2) in a group of custom metadata fields specified in an organization's editorial settings, and entered on the sory metadata panel, which is an array of Atavist Books Contributor objects, including: name, information, residence, photo, photo credit, and image orientation. An author bio and photo are additionally stored as custom metadata fields, a textarea and file upload respectively, for importing into the Atavist Store Wordpress site. In a case where a story has multiple authors, that information must be combined into a single image and textarea. The only documented method of outputting authors from native Creatavist is {{author_display}}, which outputs a plaintext list formatted, depending on the number of authors, as: "Author Name" or "Author 1 and Author 2" or "Author 1, Author 2 and Author 3". There appear to be undocumented methods of accessing {{authors}} and {{author_list}}, which includes an ID and single Name field per author. |
